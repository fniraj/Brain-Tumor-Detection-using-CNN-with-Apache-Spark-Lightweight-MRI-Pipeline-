This project, “Brain Tumor Detection using CNN with Apache Spark,” demonstrates how deep learning and distributed computing can work together for medical image analysis. A lightweight Kaggle dataset of 253 MRI images is used to classify scans as tumor or no tumor, and Apache Spark is utilized to parallelize image preprocessing and data loading across multiple virtual machines. The CNN model automatically extracts tumor-related features through convolutional layers, while Spark helps simulate a scalable big-data workflow similar to real hospital environments. The goal of this project is to build a fast, reliable, and scalable diagnostic support pipeline that can assist radiologists in early tumor detection. All data is preprocessed, trained, and evaluated using Python, Spark, and deep learning frameworks, and Grad-CAM visualizations are used to highlight which regions of the MRI influenced the model’s predictions.
